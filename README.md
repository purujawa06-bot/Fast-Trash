# Fast-Trash

## Overview
Fast-Trash is a lightweight and efficient API designed to streamline waste management processes, providing quick access to information regarding waste disposal, collection schedules, or related services. It aims to simplify the way users interact with waste management systems, making information retrieval fast and accessible.

## Features
- **Fast API Endpoints**: Quick response times for waste-related queries.
- **Scalable**: Built with a modern backend, capable of handling various loads.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for straightforward integration into existing applications or bots.
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation of concerns for easy maintenance and expansion.

## API Endpoints
This project likely includes API endpoints for various operations. Based on the file structure, here are some potential examples:

- `GET /api/testing-get`: An example GET endpoint for retrieving data.
- `POST /api/testing-post`: An example POST endpoint for submitting data.

*(Note: Specific functionality of these endpoints depends on their implementation in `api/testing-get.js` and `api/testing-post.js`.)*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository**:

    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application
To start the Fast-Trash API server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000` or a port specified in `index.js` or `vercel.json`.

## Usage
Once the API is running, you can interact with it using tools like cURL, Postman, or by integrating it into your web or mobile applications.

**Example cURL Request (GET)**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/testing-get
```

**Example cURL Request (POST)**:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"item": "plastic bottle"}' http://localhost:3000/api/testing-post
```
